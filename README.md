## [S&P 500 Smart Portfolio Analyzer](https://github.com/thomascowart3/FeaturedProjects/blob/main/S%26P500SmartPortfolioAnalyzer.ipynb)
This project is a Python-based portfolio analytics tool that allows users to compare the performance of a custom stock portfolio to the S&P 500 over the past 5 years. It automatically scrapes the current list of S&P 500 components, retrieves historical monthly closing prices from Yahoo Finance, and calculates normalized returns. The app includes an optimization feature that identifies the top N performing stocks based on total percent gain over the 5-year period, excluding incomplete data. Users can visualize performance comparisons, assess risk-adjusted returns, and receive a summary of the top stocks with company names and tickers.

Tools Used: Python Yfinance, Pandas, & Matplotlib libraries.
